This project is developed by Marco Bacis and Antonio Di Bello for the "Advanced Algorithms and Parallel Programming" 2016/2017 class.
It consists in the implementation and acceleration (through OpenMP) of the algorithms for graph similarity and matching/alignment described in

[*Kollias et al.* - Fast Parallel Algorithms for Graph Similarity and Matching, 2012, *Computer Science Technical Reports*]

### How to compile ###

**Required**
- [Boost Libraries](http://www.boost.org/)
- [OpenMPI](https://www.open-mpi.org/)
- An OpenMP-compatible compiler (e.g. gcc/g++)

**Build Procedure**
This project uses CMake as a build system.
Basic way of building
